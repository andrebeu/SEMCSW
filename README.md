# Schema Prediction Task code

More documentation to come.

## Main Results

* `SchemaPrediction v090820.ipynb.` Has code that demonstrates how the model can be run.
* `SchemaPrediction v090820. Pre-run Model Comparisons.ipynb` Analyses previously run simulations.  These can take a while to run, and these paramaters were identified from a larger parameter search (that data is not included due to size constraints, was ~10GB)

## Installation Requirements
This package has been tested in Python v3.7.9 and tensorflow 2.3.1 

To install, use the command: 

`pip install git+https://github.com/nicktfranklin/SEM2`

SEM can then be used in python as a package.  To import SEM:

`>>import sem`


The demonstrations require addtional plotting libraries (found in the requirements.txt file). These can be installed via

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
