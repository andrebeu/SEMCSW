nick meeting notes
- MSE vs KL ? 
- what is fast_mvnorm_diagonal_logprob doing
= mvnorm func calc loglikelihood of diagonal multivariate gaussian
-- NB input is difference between obs and obs_hat
-  why handle f0 and rest differently?
- why handle untrained model differently in `log_likelihood_sequence`
