# Model of Curriculum Effect on Schema Learning

this code contains mostly NF original SEM implementation. only made refactoring changes. 

run test_sem_impl.py on the terminal to get a bunch of print statements in CSWSEM and cswRNN. 

CSWSEM is main wrapper; cswRNN contains event model code

the last I used this code for was looking into how NF computed prediction errors and used PEs to calculate model sigma (variance of the estimate)

CSWSEM, the main wrapper, contains assert statements that I was using when looking into how to compute crp priors and likelihoods for schema selection

** ideally, leave this branch in case you need to double check details about NF implementation

good luck
and eudamonia,

Andre-of-the-past
